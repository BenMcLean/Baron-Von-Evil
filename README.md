# Baron Von Evil's Mansion
Baron Von Evil's Mansion is a psuedo-3D maze game written in QBasic using text for graphics. Inspired by this Javascript game: https://web.archive.org/web/20080908083419/http://www.star-dot.com/hishers/hisgames/javagame/maze.htm

# Running the program

Modern Windows systems can run the QB64 version, "EVILMAZE - QB64.exe"

MS-DOS systems can run the QB 4.5 version, "EVILMAZE.EXE"

The source code "EVILMAZE.BAS" will compile in QB 4.5 and QB64. I developed it in QBasic 1.1 but haven't tested the latest version in QBasic 1.1.

# How to play

Navigate with the arrow keys and press ESC to quit. That's all!

# About

I wrote this back in middle school, sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s. I forget exactly when.

Modifications, adding new levels, etc is encouraged! Just please tell me cause I want to see what you've done!
